# Get book summarized with a key takeaway from the book in your inbox built with OpenAI SDK & Pica OS SDK

This is a Next.js project that integrates with the OpenAI SDK and the Pica OS SDK to provide advanced AI capabilities. In this project, the OpenAI SDK is used to interact with OpenAI's API, and the Pica OS SDK allows integration with the Pica OS platform.

## Prerequisites

To get started with this project, you'll need the following:

- A **Next.js** development environment set up.
- API keys for both **OpenAI** and **Pica OS**.
  
### API Keys
Youâ€™ll need to provide valid API keys for both services in order for the project to function properly:

- **OpenAI API Key**: You can obtain this by signing up at [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) and creating a new API key.
- **Pica OS API Key**: You can obtain this by signing up at [Pica OS](https://www.picaos.com/) and generating your API key.

Once you have your API keys, you can store them securely in the `.env.local` file in the root of your project (see below for more details).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nextjs-openai-picaos.git
